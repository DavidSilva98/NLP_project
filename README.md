# Setup Environment
Before running main_final.py, the user needs to configure a separate conda environment in order to reproduce the results obtained. An environment.yml file is provided in the project repository with this objective. By creating a conda environment through the yml file, the user will be able to run the whole project without issues.

In order to create the environment the user needs to run the following commands in the anaconda prompt: **conda env create -f \<path to environment.yml>**.
